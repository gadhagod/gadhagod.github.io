  As a member of our App Development team, I have done substantial work on <a href="https://github.com/HarkerRobo/robotics-website" target="_blank">1072's website</a>, purchase request system, 
  attendance system, and other apps. Being on the team since October 2021, the experience has been awesome as I have 
  learned many new techonologies and made extensive contributions to the organization.
